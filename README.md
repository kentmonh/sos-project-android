# sos-project-android
An android app help people in emergency cases. I came up with the idea of this app because Vietnam is a country that suffers from natural disasters like flooding and landslides every year.
- Everyone can sign in by google account to add, edit, and remove locations on map
- People who need help can mark SOS on map so the rescue team can contact and help them
- Rescue team can mark them, and safe places on the map so the people who need help can contact or move to them
- I used Mapbox for the map
- Used firebase to store the location data like coordinates, address, phone number or the situation
